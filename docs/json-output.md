# JSON output contract

Every command returns structured JSON:

```json
{
  "version": "2.4",
  "ok": true,
  "command": "click",
  "data": { "action": "click" }
}
```

Errors include machine-readable codes and recovery hints:

```json
{
  "version": "2.4",
  "ok": false,
  "command": "click",
  "error": {
    "code": "STALE_REF",
    "message": "Element at @e7 no longer matches the last snapshot",
    "suggestion": "Run 'snapshot' to refresh refs, then retry",
    "recovery": {
      "strategy": "refresh_snapshot_then_retry_original",
      "retryable": true,
      "requires_fresh_snapshot": true
    },
    "disposition": {
      "delivery": "not_delivered",
      "retry": "safe"
    }
  }
}
```

Version 2.2 replaces the 2.1 `TIMEOUT` error for a budget-exhausted snapshot
with a successful, explicitly partial response, and adds `data.complete`.
Snapshot data always carries `complete`. A snapshot that runs out of budget now
returns `ok: true` with `"complete": false`, the tree it did observe,
`"truncated": true`, and `nodes_observed`, instead of a `TIMEOUT` error and no
tree. Every node whose descendants were cut short carries
`"subtree_truncated": true`, so a reader can walk from the root to each
boundary. Consumers must read `data.complete` to decide whether a tree is whole;
a `TIMEOUT` error no longer signals an oversized tree. A `--root` drill-down is
unaffected: it replaces refs inside an existing snapshot, so an incomplete
observation still returns `TIMEOUT` rather than a partial tree.

Version 2.1 replaces the 2.0 `error.retry_command` string with the structured
`error.recovery` object and adds `error.disposition`. Consumers must select a
recovery strategy from `recovery.strategy` only when `disposition.retry` is
`safe`; command strings from older envelopes must not be executed blindly.
The removed `retry_command` field has no compatibility alias.

## Version 2.4 migration

Stateful ref actions (`set-value`, `type`, `clear`, `check`, `uncheck`, `toggle`, `expand`, and `collapse`) now reject observed postcondition contradictions after one delivery attempt. Readback failures preserve the adapter's error code and carry `details.kind: "post_action_verification"`. Missing evidence alone remains a successful `delivered_unverified` result with `details.verification_scope: "unavailable"`; neither that result nor verified element state proves application-level persistence.

macOS mutation errors that do not prove non-delivery stop fallback chains with an unsafe retry disposition. This affects activation, selection, disclosure, scrolling, and window operations; an unchanged or unreadable state is not proof that a mutation was never delivered. Value-writing chains also stop after unverified delivery instead of applying a second mechanism. Failures after preparatory scrolling carry `details.preparatory_scroll` and do not authorize automatic retry.

Inspect `disposition.retry` before retrying or choosing an alternative action, regardless of `error.code`. An error may include `post_state` and `postcondition_satisfied` without erasing the original execution failure. The same verification rules apply to FFI ref actions; the C ABI is unchanged. The Rust `ActionResult::from_execution` constructor now takes only action and steps and returns an infallible result; live verification belongs to `execute_verified_action`.

## Headed action verification

- Headed ref interactions activate the exact source app/window before final pointer hit testing. Read-only readiness polling must not prevent a background target from reaching that focus phase; final hit testing remains mandatory before delivery.
- Focus and preparatory scrolling can change coordinates. Stability is verified against fresh live observations, not by requiring coordinates to remain equal to the original snapshot.
- On macOS, post-activation focus confirmation uses fresh system-wide `AXFocusedApplication` and exact-window evidence with process-generation checks. A cached `NSWorkspace` foreground snapshot is not sufficient in a process that just activated another app.
- Focusing an inactive text field can change its selection. A pre-focus range cannot establish the expected insertion into a nonempty field; such a result is explicitly unverified rather than falsely contradicted.
- A settle-loop pacing budget does not replace the caller's deadline for native reads. Tests assert deadline identity rather than arbitrary remaining-time thresholds.

## Error codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `PERM_DENIED` | Accessibility permission not granted |
| `ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND` | No element matched the ref or query |
| `APP_NOT_FOUND` | Application not running or no windows |
| `STALE_REF` | Ref could not be re-identified in the live UI |
| `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET` | Ref recovery matched multiple plausible targets |
| `SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND` | Snapshot ID is missing or expired |
| `POLICY_DENIED` | Physical/headed path blocked by policy |
| `ACTION_FAILED` | Action rejected, or its observed result contradicted the request |
| `ACTION_NOT_SUPPORTED` | The target does not expose the requested action |
| `APP_UNRESPONSIVE` | The matching application stopped responding |
| `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` | Adapter method not implemented on this platform |
| `TIMEOUT` | Wait condition expired |
| `INVALID_ARGS` | Invalid argument values |

## Exit codes

`0` success, `1` structured error (JSON on stdout), `2` argument parse error.
