//! The property every stored-path landing rests on.

//! `read_children` only ever appends, and each of its exits breaks the loop
//! rather than skipping an entry, so a truncated enumeration is a *prefix* of
//! the real child list. `descend_path` applies that one level at a time, so the
//! pins below are stated at one level and compose down the path by the loop
//! that walks it.
