//! The path tier's second reading of a stored path, for the one drift a Win32
//! container causes on its own: growing scroll bars ahead of its content.
//!
//! A `SysTreeView32` or `SysListView32` whose content outgrows the view gains a
//! vertical scroll bar, a horizontal one and the size grip between them, and
//! the proxy exposes all three as the container's *first* children. Every
//! content child's raw index moves up by the chrome count, so a path recorded
//! before the growth now descends into a scroll bar. Regedit measured it: the
//! outline's children went from `[Computer]` to `[scrollbar, scrollbar,
//! handle, Computer]` the moment `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` expanded, and the broad
//! search the declined landing fell through to then read every one of the
//! expanded key's thousands of subkeys and spent the whole deadline.

/// Leading chrome is the two scroll bars and the size grip (at most three
/// children, roles `scrollbar` and `handle`). A level is shifted past it only
/// when the stored index lands *inside* the chrome, the one reading that
/// cannot be ambiguous: a content ref recorded after the chrome appeared
/// counts it and never lands there. A stored index that lands on content is
/// walked as stored even though it may have been recorded before the chrome
/// appeared, because shifting it could enter a different container whose
/// child shares the stored identity, and a wrong verified target is worse
/// than leaving that ref to the broad search. The identity check reads the
/// landing's own siblings (a list wider than 64 declines), and any read fault
/// declines.
///
/// The stored bounds are deliberately not consulted. A container that grew
/// scroll bars also re-laid out and usually scrolled, so the stored rectangle
/// names a position that no longer exists.
