//! HRESULT/sentinel failure classification.
//!
//! Turns one UI Automation failure - whether a COM HRESULT or a
//! `uiautomation` crate sentinel - into a structured `AdapterError` carrying
//! the typed `complete`/`retryable` disposition the resolution retry loop and
//! core's hydration read off the details payload.
//!
//! Split from `automation.rs` to separate this classification table from the
//! automation-client bootstrap and bounded-root resolution it feeds
//! (`automation.rs`): the table grows every time a newly-observed HRESULT or
//! sentinel needs a mapping, while the client plumbing does not change with
//! it.
//!
//! Each code family is named exactly once. The HRESULT side is
//! `hresult::hresult_record` (`crates/windows/src/system/hresult.rs`); the
//! sentinel side is this module's own `sentinel_record`. Before this, one
//! code's read-path `ReadDisposition` and its caller-facing `ErrorCode` lived
//! in two separate matches that agreed only because both were edited by hand
//! together - `ERR_INVALID_OBJECT`'s `StaleRef`/`Unavailable` pairing was
//! never itself asserted anywhere. One record per code makes that pairing the
//! only thing that can be written down.
