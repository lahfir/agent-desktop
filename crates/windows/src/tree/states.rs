/// Microsoft's ARIA state table gives `IsDataValidForForm` as the source, and

/// emitted `invalid` on **every node of every one of them** - 26 of 26 on
/// Notepad, 113 of 113 on Explorer - on static text, title bars, windows and
/// menus alike.
///
/// `false` is that property's *default*, not an assertion. It means no form
/// rule declares the element valid, which is true of everything that is not a
/// form field. `IsRequiredForForm` shares the default and is safe only because
/// `required` is emitted on `true`, a positive claim; `invalid` read the
/// default as a claim and so decorated the whole tree. The property cannot
/// distinguish "not applicable" from "invalid" on any stack measured here, so
/// it is not read at all and `invalid` stays unproduced rather than faked -
/// the correct outcome for a token whose platform source turns out unusable.
///
/// # `pressed` is produced from `LegacyIAccessibleState`
///
/// A `button` role with the `STATE_SYSTEM_PRESSED` bit set in its
/// `LegacyIAccessibleState` emits the `pressed` state. This covers the toolbar
/// toggle button, which was measured advertising no `TogglePattern` at all -
/// only `Invoke` and `LegacyIAccessible` - and carrying its pressed state in
/// the legacy bit alone. `roles.rs`'s `button_role`
/// reclassifies `Button` controls that advertise `ToggleAvailable` to
/// `Role::Switch`, so toggle buttons surface as `switch` + `checked` on
/// Windows. A `button` role reaching this function with the `STATE_SYSTEM_PRESSED`
/// bit set represents a different pattern: a button whose pressed state is
/// exposed through the legacy MSAA interface rather than through UI Automation
/// patterns. macOS's `state_reader.rs` emits `pressed` for toggle buttons in
/// the same logical pattern (role `button` + checked value).
///
/// # Known vs Unknown
/// `LocatorField::Unknown` is returned only when every [`READ_HEALTH_PROBES`]
/// source came back `PropertyOutcome::Unknown` too - the shape a property
/// nobody ever read produces. That means the state read itself never
/// happened, which is not the same fact as "this element carries no states",
/// so it must not be reported as an empty `Known` vector. A single probe that
/// came back `Known` or `Absent` is proof the batch reached this element, and
/// from that point an empty vector is a legitimate, positive answer.
