//! The bounded sibling enumeration and child-index path descent that both
//! resolvers drive.
//!
//! The broad search and the locator anchor walk the same two cross-process
//! primitives - one `first_child` followed by a `next_sibling` chain - under
//! the same sibling cap and the same deadline. They differ in exactly two
//! decisions: what a failed enumeration step means, and what an expired
//! deadline means. Those two are the parameters; the loop is written once.
//!
//! The loop consults the deadline on every iteration, mirroring the element
//! walk's own enumeration (`walker_enumerate.rs`). Checking it only around the
//! enumeration would let a pathological list run the whole sibling cap - up to
//! `WalkBudget::max_siblings` cross-process calls - after the budget was
//! already spent.

/// exposes no items at all to a COM client (A17-2).

/// Reporting the truncation unfinished would cost more honesty than it buys,
/// for two reasons. The bound is shared with the walk that issues refs in the
/// first place: `walk_from_root` enumerates under the same
/// `WalkBudget::max_siblings` and refuses to present a cap-cut child list as
/// whole, so no stored ref can name an element past this point in its parent's
/// sibling list. And an unfinished verdict is not scoped to the node that
/// truncated - it withholds the entire search's answer, so one oversized list
/// anywhere in a window would convert a correct settled miss elsewhere in that
/// window into a retry loop that re-truncates identically on every attempt and
/// expires as `TIMEOUT`.
