//! Every `MenuFixture` spawned below is a re-exec'd child of this same test
//! binary, so it shares its process image name with every other such
//! fixture in this crate. Each test that spawns one holds
//! `test_support::FIXTURE_APP_NAME_LOCK` for the fixture's entire lifetime,
//! exactly as `system::wait_tests` and `system::menu_state_tests` hold it
//! around theirs, so this file's own fixture cannot coexist with a
//! concurrently running `list_apps`-by-name-resolving test and defeat that
//! test's resolution.
