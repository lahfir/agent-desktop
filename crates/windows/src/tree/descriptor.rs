/// Every slot is a positive claim: a failed or gated source read contributes
/// nothing, per the tri-state rule (`emit-state-on-a-positive-claim-never-on-a-default`).
/// All four sources are `Known`-only emissions resolved by the same walk batch,
/// so nothing here costs a round trip.
///
/// Sources, each confirmed by the A16 probe family:
/// - `role_description` ← `LocalizedControlType` (A16-5: populated on every
///   control type across all three stacks, zero failed reads; the content is
///   the provider's display vocabulary, so it is not target text and never
///   withheld by the secure gate).
/// - `subrole` ← `AriaRole` (A16-6: non-empty on 164 of 165 settled Chromium
///   elements with short ARIA vocabulary tokens; a failed read produces no
///   subrole). `AriaRole` is provider vocabulary by the caller's pre-committed
///   branch - the verbatim-author-text sub-question returned zero on this box,
///   so it is not target text either.
/// - `placeholder` ← `HelpText`, but only where `HelpText` is not already the
///   description (the richer `FullDescription` wins the description slot).
/// - `dom_classes` has no source on the pinned stack (A16-6 measured
///   `AriaProperties` carrying no `class` token, and `HtmlClass` does not exist
///   in `uiautomation` 0.25.0), so it stays empty - the schema is settled for
///   whichever platform first produces it, and this one does not yet.
