//! Surface-root resolution tests: the per-surface match arms, and the live
//! advertise/resolve/emit equality the shell kinds and `Menu` were added
//! under.
//!
//! The shell-surface legs hold `test_support::SHELL_SURFACE_LOCK` - the same
//! lock `system::shell_surface_tests` holds - because the surfaces they open
//! are machine-global: a concurrently running test that dismisses or raises
//! the Action Center would resolve a surface this file had already
//! dismissed. Fixture legs hold `FIXTURE_APP_NAME_LOCK` for the fixture's
//! lifetime per that lock's own contract; where a test takes both, the
//! fixture lock is taken first, matching the crate-wide ordering.
