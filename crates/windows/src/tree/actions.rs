/// `ScrollItem`. `LegacyIAccessible` availability is not one of those: A2-2
/// measured it `true` on 141 of 141 elements, so treating it as an affordance
/// would ref-allocate every element in every tree. It contributes exactly one
/// action, `Click`, and only when `LegacyDefaultAction` itself reads as a
/// non-empty string - the gate measured working: button, checkbox and list
/// item non-empty; edit, text and container roles empty.
/// `SetFocus` is emitted truthfully from `IsKeyboardFocusable`, but core
/// already declines to treat a bare `SetFocus` as a primary action, so it can
/// never be the sole reason an element becomes ref-able.
///
/// `Known(vec)` is returned once the read set succeeded, including when the
/// vector is empty - that is the legitimate answer for an inert element.
/// `Unknown` is returned only when every one of the eight affordance
/// availability properties, `LegacyDefaultAction` and `IsKeyboardFocusable`
/// read `Unknown`: nothing was learned about this element's affordances, so
/// there is nothing to report `Known` about. A single failed property among
/// otherwise-successful reads does not void the whole answer - that property
/// simply contributes no affordance, the same way an unread pattern would on
/// a provider that never implemented it.
