//! The locator-anchor resolver: selected-match hydration's path-only
//! variant of `resolve_element_strict`.
//!
//! Core's `live_locator::hydrate` re-observes the matched subtree from the
//! return handle and enforces evidence completeness itself; Windows only has to
//! land the anchor. The anchor's path is exact from the just-walked tree, so
//! there is **no broad-search fallback** - and its classification is the
//! inverse of the strict search's: every step is descent along a stored path
//! that churn makes permanently wrong, so a path step that lands nowhere, a
//! role-refuted candidate, or a vanished node **settles the attempt
//! immediately** (a completed-search `STALE_REF`, one attempt, the deadline
//! intact for core's fresh re-observation). Only the unresponsive/transport
//! class runs through the bounded retry loop, which re-walks the same cheap
//! O(depth) path rather than replaying an expensive search.
//!
//! An expired deadline is the one failure that must not settle. There was no
//! attempt left to settle: a path walk cut short by the deadline lands short
//! of the stored index, and reporting that as a miss would tell core the
//! element is genuinely gone when the truth is only that time ran out. It
//! surfaces as `TIMEOUT` instead.
