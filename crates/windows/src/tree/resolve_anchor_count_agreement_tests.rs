/// `find --count` and a materialized `find` must select the same set from the
/// same query.
///
/// The two run different paths - count mode resolves a total without ever
/// materializing a match - so a divergence between them is invisible to any
/// test that exercises one alone. What is pinned is the agreement relation,
/// never a literal total: the number is a property of today's fixture and
/// changes when a control is added, while the relation is the requirement and
/// holds whatever the fixture grows. The query is chosen to match more than one
/// control, because a single-match query satisfies agreement no matter how
/// either mode selected.
///
/// A real application is a poor control here, since its own count moves
/// underneath the assertion; the hosted fixture is repo-owned and
/// deterministic, so a disagreement can only come from the code under test.
