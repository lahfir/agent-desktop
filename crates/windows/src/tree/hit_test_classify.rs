//! Hit-element classification, the pre-probe guard ladder, and the budget the
//! ancestor walks are charged against.
//!
//! Self or descendant → `ReachesTarget`. Ancestor of the target → `Unknown`
//! directly: unlike macOS, UIA's `ElementFromPoint` is desktop-global with no
//! application-scoped retry, so the arm that would only refine toward
//! `Unknown` is the answer — Chromium render-host panes land here when web
//! content is not hit-addressable. Incomplete ancestry walks → `Unknown`.
//! Unrelated hits hand off to corroboration.
//!
//! Every ancestor step is a cross-process call, so the operation deadline is
//! consulted once per step and a truncated walk is `Incomplete` — the same
//! `Unknown` a failed step produces, never an interception on partial evidence.
//!
//! Rectangle membership is half-open on the right and bottom edges, the Win32
//! `RECT` convention the `07-hittest` probe used: a point on the virtual
//! screen's far edge addresses the first pixel outside it, and A18-6 measured
//! `ElementFromPoint` answering with the desktop at exactly such coordinates.
