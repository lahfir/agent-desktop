//! Every `ModalFixture` spawned below is a re-exec'd child of this same test
//! binary, so it shares its process image name with every other such
//! fixture in this crate. Each test that spawns one holds
//! `test_support::FIXTURE_APP_NAME_LOCK` for the fixture's entire lifetime,
//! exactly as `system::signal_surfaces_tests` and
//! `system::wait_surface_live_tests` hold it around theirs, so this file's
//! own fixture cannot coexist with a concurrently running
//! `list_apps`-by-name-resolving test and defeat that test's resolution.
