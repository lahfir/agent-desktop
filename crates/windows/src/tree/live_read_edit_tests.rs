//! Proves the shared live read's value projection reflects a same-process
//! edit made after resolution, rather than a stale or always-absent one -
//! not that production's out-of-process path converges, which this run
//! measured and could not confirm (see below).
//!
//! `live_read_tests.rs` used to call `live_value` and discard the result -
//! a call that can never fail, so it proved nothing about whether the
//! projection reflects the target's current state rather than a stale or
//! always-absent one. This module mutates the fixture's plain `EDIT`
//! control's window text directly with `SetWindowTextW`, the same primitive
//! `resolve_anchor_selector_wait_tests.rs` uses on the fixture's button, then
//! asserts the next live read reports the new text.
//!
//! Hosted on `LocalFixture`, not the crate's default `HostedFixture`,
//! measured rather than assumed: driven first through `HostedFixture`, a
//! `SetWindowTextW` mutation of the owning (separate) process's control was
//! not observed by `GetCurrentPropertyValue` for either `Value` or
//! `LegacyValue` even after a multi-second poll, a brand-new
//! `ElementFromHandle` taken after the mutation, and an explicit
//! `NotifyWinEvent` - the cross-process legacy-control value bridge in this
//! environment did not converge within any bound this test could use, which
//! is a fact about how production `get --property value` behaves against a
//! legacy out-of-process control, not only about this test's harness; it is
//! recorded as a residual in `docs/dogfood-reports/`. The same mutation
//! against a `LocalFixture` control is observed on the very next read, which
//! is the narrower, in-process claim this module's tests actually establish.
//! `fixture.rs`'s warning on `LocalFixture` - "never use it to validate the
//! walk's failure classification or the cache policy" - does not cover this:
//! this test validates the projection's plumbing, not cross-process failure
//! taxonomy or the cache policy.
