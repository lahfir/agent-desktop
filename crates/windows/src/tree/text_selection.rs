//! The Text pattern selection read for `TypeText` verification.
//!
//! Core asks for the selected range in UTF-16 code units so it can predict what
//! a field should contain once typed text replaces the selection. UI Automation
//! text ranges do not promise UTF-16 indexing, so the offset is derived from
//! the text itself: the prefix range spans document-start to selection-start
//! and its UTF-16 length is the start offset, with the selected text's UTF-16
//! length giving the extent. No endpoint magnitude is compared numerically,
//! because a provider's comparison result is not a character count.
