/// Runs one observation: resolve the root, walk it, detect a Chromium shell,
/// and report completeness honestly.
///
/// The walk itself already produces honest boundaries: at a logical or raw
/// depth boundary it has already enumerated the full child list (bounded by
/// the sibling and deadline budgets), so `children_count` is the real count and
/// `subtree_truncated` records that descendants were not walked - the two flags
/// set independently (a boundary node may carry a count with
/// `subtree_truncated: true`). A deadline-starved walk reports the partial
/// tree it observed with `complete: false`, never as a discard.
///
/// This function adds what the walk cannot decide for itself:
///
/// 1. **Enumeration-failure surfacing**: a walk with real faults returns a
///    structured error, never a silently-truncated success.
/// 2. **Liveness-checked completeness**: a walk that would report `complete`
///    is only trusted after the root re-verifies live; failure is
///    `WINDOW_NOT_FOUND`, never a complete-looking tree.
/// 3. **Chromium shell detection**: a full-depth walk of a detected Chromium
///    root that lands on the pre-activation shell returns the
///    activation-required error, which core's loop settles and retries. The
///    marker keeps being returned - re-arming core's retry loop - for as
///    long as the deadline still has room for another walk of the shape
///    just measured; only once that room runs out does a still-thin tree
///    return the plain guidance error core's loop treats as final. The
///    "settle already ran" state is scoped per process, so a batch or
///    session observing several processes through one adapter gives every
///    process its own settle rather than the first process's activation
///    suppressing every later one. When the caller already forced renderer
///    accessibility (`--force-electron-a11y`), the adapter still reverifies
///    the root is live before returning the observed tree instead of the
///    guidance error - the flag's contract is to skip activation guidance,
///    not liveness.
