//! The seam-driven half of the shared live read's tests.

//! Every case here drives `read_live_element_core` through one of the
//! closures it is generic over - the corroborator, the property read, the
//! label read - because each stands in for a condition a real fixture cannot
//! be made to produce on demand: a process that dies mid-read, a resolved
//! element that vanishes while its process stays alive, a read that comes
//! back with nothing in it, a budget that runs out between the property read
//! and the label read. The projections over an ordinary successful read stay
//! in `live_read_tests.rs`, and the completeness predicate's own truth table
//! in `live_read_gate_tests.rs`.
