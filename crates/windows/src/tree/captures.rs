//! Where the committed COM evidence lives, and the normalisation rules it is
//! held to.
//!
//! The captures under `docs/plans/2026-07-27-002-captures/` are produced by
//! `crates/windows/examples/uia_tree_dump.rs` on a developer machine, in the
//! UIA3 COM stack the adapter ships. Earlier dumps taken on the managed stack
//! are not comparable: A2-4 measured the identical Notepad window reporting
//! as 3 nodes against 26 on COM, so they cannot serve as COM expectations.
//!
//! Nothing in CI asserts what the captures contain - that would be an
//! `app/provider` assertion R9 forbids. What is asserted here is the
//! **redaction rule**: a capture that leaks a process id, a provider id, a
//! window handle or a user path is a defect regardless of what tree it holds.
//!
//! Dogfood censuses are deliberately **not** committed and so are not listed
//! here. They run to thousands of lines of JSON, they are regenerated on
//! demand by `probes/windows/scratch/run-dogfood.ps1`, and everything a later
//! reader needs from them - the findings, the per-target judgements, the
//! coverage numbers - is written up in the report under
//! `docs/dogfood-reports/`. Committing the raw census as well would carry the
//! bulk without the meaning. The redaction rule those files are held to lives
//! with the renderer that applies it, in
//! `crates/windows/examples/uia_tree_dump/render_slots.rs`.
