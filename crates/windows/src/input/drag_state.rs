//! Drag delivery/release-guard state.
//!
//! A `MouseInputEvent` batch is plain data - unlike macOS's `CGEvent`-backed
//! guard, constructing the corrective batch here cannot fail. The guard
//! arms immediately before the first committed injection (mouse-down) and
//! disarms only after the final release posts; its `Drop` is the sole place
//! that posts corrective input, and it always targets the **origin**, never
//! the destination, per
//! docs/solutions/best-practices/abort-state-guidance-multi-step-physical-input.md.
//! Cleanup is best-effort like every other post here: `SendInput`'s return
//! value is never treated as delivery evidence (A9-3), so an abort reports
//! `emergency_release_posted` without claiming the OS acknowledged it.
