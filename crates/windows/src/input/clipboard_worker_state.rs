//! Whether a clipboard read this process started is still inside a Win32 call.
//!
//! A read that services a delay-rendered format blocks inside
//! `GetClipboardData` for as long as the owning application takes. When the
//! caller's deadline expires, the caller is told the read timed out — but the
//! worker is still parked in the OS call, so its session's `Drop` cannot run
//! and this process holds the clipboard open for the rest of the render. A
//! thread blocked in a Win32 call cannot be cancelled, so the answer is not to
//! stop it: it is to refuse the next clipboard operation instead of letting it
//! contend with a worker nothing can reclaim, and to say so.
//!
//! The reach of that refusal is exactly one process, and the shipped docs say
//! so. An abandoned worker dies with the process that spawned it and Windows
//! releases the clipboard on exit, so a retry from a fresh invocation neither
//! needs this guard nor is affected by it. What it governs is a second
//! clipboard operation inside one invocation — a batch entry, or a command
//! that reads twice.
