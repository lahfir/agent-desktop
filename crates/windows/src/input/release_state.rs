//! Armed-and-counted state shared by every physical release guard.
//!
//! A click guard and a drag guard differ only in what corrective input they
//! post on abort and how they phrase the recovery hint; the state machine
//! underneath - armed until the final release posts, counting committed
//! injections - is one behaviour, and the delivery report it produces is a
//! contract (`delivered_events`, `emergency_release_posted`,
//! `emergency_release_acknowledged`, and the not-delivered versus
//! delivered-unverified split). Kept in one place so a guard added later
//! inherits the report instead of restating it, and so the two existing
//! guards cannot drift apart on what an interrupted sequence claims.
//!
//! Cleanup itself stays with each guard's `Drop`: only the guard knows
//! whether the corrective post is a button-up in place or a move back to the
//! origin first.
