//! The located menu element for the `Menu` surface arm: the locating shapes of
//! the detector's sources, returning the element instead of a bool, split out
//! of `menu_state.rs` on the 400-line file cap - the same purely mechanical
//! split `menu_state_multi.rs` is - with the predicates they answer shared
//! from there rather than duplicated.
//!
//! Each source locates on its own and [`locate_menu`] composes them, so a
//! source whose pool is empty answers "not mine" and the next source is still
//! asked. Composing them the other way round - one source's empty pool ending
//! the whole search - is what made a Chromium DOM menu unrootable while the
//! detector reported it open.
