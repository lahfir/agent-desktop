//! Windows-only: drives real classic Win32 menus (`MenuFixture`) and a
//! non-pumping window (`StalledFixture`) against both measured sources
//! (A23-1, A23-11) and their union. A23-10 grounds the no-GUI-thread and
//! nonexistent-pid cases.
//!
//! Every `MenuFixture` here is a re-exec'd child of this same test binary, so
//! it shares its process image name with every other such fixture in this
//! crate. Each test that spawns one holds `test_support::FIXTURE_APP_NAME_LOCK`
//! for its fixture's entire lifetime so it cannot coexist with another
//! lock-holding test's fixture and defeat that test's `list_apps`-by-name
//! resolution.
//!
//! `menu_is_open_is_isolated_to_the_queried_process` additionally forces OS
//! foreground onto its fixture via `raise_handle`
//! (`AttachThreadInput`/`SetForegroundWindow`), which can stall an unrelated
//! thread's message pump while the input queues are attached. It therefore
//! also holds `fixture_window::on_screen_stage` for as long as it forces
//! foreground, the same DESKTOP/FOREGROUND-state guard
//! `window_ops_tests.rs`'s focused-filter test and `key_dispatch_tests.rs`
//! already take. Where a test needs both locks, `FIXTURE_APP_NAME_LOCK` is
//! always acquired first and `on_screen_stage` second - taking them in the
//! opposite order anywhere in this crate would deadlock the suite against a
//! test that acquires them the mandated way.
//!
//! Win32 menu mode is canceled by activation change: any other window
//! gaining OS foreground sends the menu's owner `WM_CANCELMODE` and the
//! fixture's context menu dismisses out from under whichever test opened it.
//! `classic_source_detects_the_fixtures_context_menu_open_and_closed`,
//! `uia_source_detects_the_fixtures_context_menu_open_and_closed`, and
//! `menu_is_open_reports_the_fixtures_transition_in_both_directions` each
//! hold a menu open across an assertion window, so each also takes
//! `fixture_window::on_screen_stage` for that span even though none of them
//! stages anything itself - the same "guards screen state, not only screen
//! real estate" reasoning `window_ops_tests.rs`'s focused-filter test
//! documents. The two directions that never expect a transition
//! (`a_pid_with_no_gui_threads_reports_closed_rather_than_erroring` and the
//! never-*opens* half of `wait_tests.rs`'s timeout test) are unaffected by a
//! foreign dismissal and do not need the lock.
