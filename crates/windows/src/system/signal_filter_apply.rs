/// Applies `SignalFilter` to an already-assembled `SignalWindowInventory`.
///
/// The filter intersects rather than alternates: when `filter.process` is
/// set, only entities carrying that exact pid and `process_instance` survive;
/// when `filter.app` is also set, entities must additionally match the app
/// name. The caller sets both fields on every wait that is not itself
/// waiting for a launch, and two Windows processes routinely share one image
/// name, so matching by name alone would return every pid sharing that name
/// and make the caller's own process-identity check fail with a
/// non-retryable stale-reference error. Intersecting keeps every returned
/// entity's identity provably exact, which is what that check requires.
///
/// Filtering runs after assembly, over entities whose identity is already
/// resolved, so `windows_complete`, `apps_complete` and
/// `excluded_window_count` travel through unchanged: none of them reflect
/// what the filter removed, only what the walk itself could not identify.
