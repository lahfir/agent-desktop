//! Talking to a renderer that may or may not exist yet.
//!
//! One connection carries one control and reads back at most one byte. The
//! read never parks a thread: `PeekNamedPipe` is polled to a deadline and
//! `ReadFile` is called only once bytes are already waiting.
//!
//! That is a departure from the overlapped-`ReadFile`-plus-`CancelIoEx` shape
//! the decision named, and the property the decision was made for is the one
//! kept: no clipboard-shaped park, where a thread sits in a Win32 call past
//! its own deadline with nothing able to reclaim it. Polling reaches that
//! property with no `OVERLAPPED` lifetime to get wrong and no cancellation
//! semantics to get subtly wrong, which for a first implementation is fewer
//! unsafe invariants rather than more.
