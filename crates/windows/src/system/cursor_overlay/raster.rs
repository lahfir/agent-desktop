//! The overlay's pixels, composited by hand into a premultiplied buffer.
//!
//! Every GDI raster primitive — `Ellipse`, `Polygon`, `FillRect`, `DrawTextW`
//! alike — writes RGB into a 32bpp DIB and leaves the alpha byte at zero, so
//! anything drawn through GDI is invisible under `ULW_ALPHA`. Forcing alpha
//! across a rectangle afterwards rescues an opaque rectangle and nothing
//! else: an anti-aliased edge and a soft ring need per-pixel coverage, which
//! is the very thing being destroyed.
//!
//! So every shape the overlay draws is composited here instead, with coverage
//! computed rather than approximated: the surface, the coverage walk and the
//! blend live in this module, the glyph and the ripple with them, and the two
//! rounded rectangles in `rounded` alongside. GDI draws only the label text,
//! onto a bubble body that has already been made opaque - and even there the
//! alpha byte is written directly as the glyphs are copied back, rather than
//! forced across a rectangle afterwards, so the bubble's rounded corners are
//! never in reach of it.
//!
//! Being pure is the other half of the point: the alpha behaviour that makes
//! this necessary is assertable without a window.
