//! An off-screen 32-bit surface GDI can draw into, and the teardown that goes
//! with it.
//!
//! Both the layered-window present and the label's glyph pass need the same
//! thing: a screen DC, a memory DC compatible with it, and a top-down 32bpp
//! DIB section selected into that memory DC. Each had its own copy, including
//! its own copy of the release sequence - restore the previously selected
//! bitmap, delete the bitmap, delete the memory DC, release the screen DC - in
//! an order that leaks GDI handles if it is got wrong, and leaks them silently.
//! Holding it once means there is one order to be right about.
//!
//! That release is not covered by a test, and the reason is worth stating so
//! nobody adds one that only appears to cover it. Three oracles were tried and
//! measured here: a loop of a few hundred surfaces cannot fail, because leaking
//! two objects a round stays inside the ten thousand a process may hold;
//! `GetGuiResources` answers zero for this process, through a real handle as
//! well as the pseudo one; and `GetObjectType` on the handles after a correct
//! release already reports live objects, because GDI reuses handle values
//! immediately, so a freed handle cannot be told from a reissued one. What
//! guards the release now is that there is one of it instead of two.
//!
//! The height is negative on purpose. A positive height gives a bottom-up DIB,
//! which draws the whole surface mirrored; the rasterizer here works top-down,
//! as does every rectangle it is handed.
