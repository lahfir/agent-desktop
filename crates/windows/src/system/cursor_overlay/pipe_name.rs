//! The generation is not decoration. A renderer left running by an earlier
//! build keeps serving a rebuilt binary's controls if the name it answers on
//! does not change when the protocol does — which happens on any rebuild
//! during a live session, this branch's own end-to-end runs included. macOS
//! hashes its protocol version into the socket path for the same reason.
