/// The gap matters because of how the text gets there. GDI writes RGB and
/// leaves the alpha byte at zero, so the glyphs are visible only where the
/// body beneath them is already opaque and the alpha is written back by hand
/// as they are copied in. Break either half and the label is drawn onto
/// transparency: under `ULW_ALPHA` the card still appears, correctly shaped
/// and correctly coloured, and simply says nothing. A caption that silently
/// stops arriving is the whole point of the caption gone, with a frame that
/// looks right in every other respect.
