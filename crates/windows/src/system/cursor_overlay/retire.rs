//! Removing a renderer left drawing by a generation this build cannot address.
//!
//! The control pipe's name hashes the protocol generation, so a renderer from
//! an earlier generation is not merely out of date — it is unreachable. Its
//! window is topmost, click-through and absent from the taskbar, and every
//! control this build sends routes past it to a name it does not serve. The
//! session-manifest watch does not help either: the session has not ended.
//! Without this pass nothing in the product can take that window off screen.
//!
//! Which generations are stale is not guessed from the running processes.
//! Reading another process's command line means walking its PEB, a COM query
//! or a shell out — hundreds of milliseconds and a great deal of unsafe code,
//! on a path that runs before every overlay is enabled. The ledger already
//! knows the answer, and a pipe name is a pure function of it.
