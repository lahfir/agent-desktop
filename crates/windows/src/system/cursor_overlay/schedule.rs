//! When to sample the cursor's pose, and when it has arrived.
//!
//! Pure. Core owns the trajectory — `CursorMotion` is a function of elapsed
//! milliseconds — so the renderer's job is to decide when to ask, not where
//! the cursor is. A dropped frame therefore changes smoothness and never the
//! arrival instant, and arrival is answered by elapsed time rather than by a
//! frame count.
//!
//! The refresh reading is clamped rather than trusted. `GetDeviceCaps`
//! answers `VREFRESH` for the screen DC, but the value is a driver's report:
//! a zero would produce an infinite frame rate and an absurd value would
//! produce a budget the paint cannot meet. Both ends are bounded here so no
//! caller has to remember to.
