//! The renderer: one process, one window, one pipe, for as long as its
//! session lasts.
//!
//! Entered before argument parsing, so a process launched as the child never
//! reaches the CLI. It claims its pipe **first** and creates its window
//! second: the pipe is the singleton lock, and a child that loses that race
//! has to withdraw before anything is drawn, or a duplicate overlay flashes
//! on screen. A child whose window then fails to appear exits too, releasing
//! the name so the next enable can start a replacement rather than
//! connecting forever to a renderer that draws nothing.
