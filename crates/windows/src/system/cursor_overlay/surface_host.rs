//! The renderer's state: where the cursor is, what style it wears, and what
//! it does when a control arrives.
//!
//! Core owns the trajectory. `CursorMotion` is a function of elapsed
//! milliseconds, so this samples a clock rather than counting frames — a
//! dropped frame changes smoothness and never the instant the cursor lands,
//! which is the instant the action is waiting on.
//!
//! A control is served in two halves. `apply` does only what has to be true
//! before its sender is answered: the style and the caption are adopted, and
//! a travel puts the cursor at its destination. `settle` plays what nothing
//! waits on — the card easing in, the click flourish — after the answer has
//! gone out and the connection has been released, so the next control is
//! already being read while the last one is still finishing on screen.
