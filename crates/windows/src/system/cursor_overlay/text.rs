//! The label's text, and the one place GDI is allowed to draw.
//!
//! GDI writes RGB and leaves the alpha byte at zero, which is why every other
//! element is composited by hand. Text is the exception because a glyph
//! rasterizer is not something to hand-roll: it is drawn into a scratch
//! surface, then copied into the overlay's buffer at full opacity, over a
//! bubble body already composited opaque. Forcing alpha across that inset
//! rectangle is correct rather than a workaround — the rounded corners it
//! would otherwise square off are outside it.
//!
//! The font is created with `ANTIALIASED_QUALITY` rather than ClearType,
//! because subpixel anti-aliasing composited through `UpdateLayeredWindow`
//! against transparency fringes with colour.
