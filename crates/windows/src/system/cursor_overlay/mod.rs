//! The Windows cursor overlay: a detached renderer this process can reach.
//!
//! The CLI is stateless per invocation, so the thing that draws has to outlive
//! the process that asked for it. The shape is the one macOS already uses — a
//! detached child of the same binary, reached over a local transport, holding
//! a click-through window it repaints as controls arrive.
//!
//! Split by responsibility rather than by size: the pipe's name, the control
//! framing and the frame schedule are pure and answer on any host, while the
//! window and its paint need a desktop. Keeping the first group free of Win32
//! is what lets a mixed-DPI arrangement this rig cannot present be covered by
//! a test.
