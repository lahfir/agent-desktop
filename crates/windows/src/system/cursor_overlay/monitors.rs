//! Which monitor a point belongs to, and where on it the overlay draws.
//!
//! Pure functions over a supplied monitor list, which is the whole point:
//! A29-6 records this host as one monitor at one scale, so a mixed-DPI or
//! multi-monitor arrangement cannot be observed here. Keeping the selection
//! and the mapping free of Win32 is what lets a test present an arrangement
//! the desktop cannot.
//!
//! The list is crate-local rather than core's `DisplayInfo`, and that is a
//! decision rather than an oversight. `DisplayInfo` carries id, bounds,
//! primary and scale and no work area, and the overlay needs the work area to
//! place a label and to pick a resting point. Extending it would change
//! `list-displays` output on both platforms, which is a wider change than the
//! overlay needs.
