//! The live monitor list and the refresh rate, read from the desktop.
//!
//! The refresh source is `GetDeviceCaps(VREFRESH)` on the screen DC, not
//! `EnumDisplaySettings`: the obvious call fails on this class of host and
//! leaves its frequency at zero, which a frame clock would take as an
//! infinite rate. The clamp downstream is the second guard; this is the
//! first.
//!
//! The monitor record is crate-local rather than core's `DisplayInfo`
//! because the overlay needs each monitor's **work area** to place a label
//! and to pick a resting point, and `DisplayInfo` carries none. Extending it
//! would change `list-displays` output on both platforms.
