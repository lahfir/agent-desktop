//! Reading a token's user, which the control pipe's peer check depends on.

//! Split from `owner_tests.rs` so that file stays inside the size cap.

use crate::system::private_file::owner::{TokenSource, token_user_sid};

/// A token opened by a caller answers the same user as this process's own,
/// which is the question every peer check on the control pipe asks.
///
/// The reader this exercises replaced one that allocated a byte vector and
/// read a `TOKEN_USER` straight out of it. That structure holds a pointer, so
/// the read was unaligned - correct only while the allocator happened to hand
/// back an aligned block, and undefined the moment it did not. There is no way
/// to assert alignment after the fact; what is asserted is that the aligned
/// reader answers, and answers the same principal, through both doors.
///
/// What this cannot see, measured rather than assumed: swapping the handle
/// arm to read the token's OWNER instead of its user leaves this green,
/// because on an account whose owner and user are the same SID the two are
/// indistinguishable here. It discriminates a genuinely different principal -
/// reading the primary group instead fails it - so it guards the door being
/// open and reaching one principal, not the choice of information class.
