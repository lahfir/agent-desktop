//! Windows-only: drives `agent_desktop_core::commands::open_system_surface`
//! end to end - through the real adapter, the real kind table, the real
//! interaction lease - and proves the R1 round trip with the crate's own
//! command functions: the window identity the open returns is the identity
//! the observation stack consumes, with no second lookup in between.
//!
//! The consumer leg runs the `snapshot` command with `--surface <kind>`
//! rather than `--window <id>`. On this platform that is the same fact, not
//! a weaker one: the agent-window inventory deliberately excludes the shell
//! chrome (the taskbar fails the tool-window filter, A26-1 measured the
//! immersive family absent from `EnumWindows` entirely), which is exactly
//! why the shell-surface resolution seam exists. The snapshot therefore
//! reaches the surface only through the shell-surface seam, and asserting
//! the id it consumed equals the id the open returned is the round trip.
//!
//! Every test holds `test_support::SHELL_SURFACE_LOCK` - the surfaces are
//! machine-global - and, because the command takes the real cross-process
//! interaction lease, `with_interaction_lease_test_lock` for its body. The
//! shell lock is taken first; no lease test ever takes the shell lock, so
//! the ordering cannot cycle.
