//! The independent raise-response oracle behind the shell-surface skip
//! convention.
//!
//! `shell_declined_the_surface` classifies the product's own TIMEOUT
//! envelopes, so on its own it cannot tell a declining desktop from a product
//! whose resolver or raise machinery regressed - the same envelope comes back
//! for both, and every immersive round-trip test would skip green. This
//! module observes whether the shell answered a raise at all, reading raw
//! Win32 and UI Automation state directly: `GetForegroundWindow`,
//! `automation_client` + `get_root_element` + `find_all(Children)` over the
//! desktop root, and a raw `EnumWindows` pass. The product's resolver and
//! raise path are never consulted - that is the independence the skip
//! decision was missing.
//!
//! Residual limits, stated where they belong:
//!
//! - A raise whose chord was dropped before the OS is indistinguishable from
//!   a shell-less desktop by observation alone: nothing on the desktop
//!   changes, the oracle answers "did not respond", and the leg skips - the
//!   regression that broke the raise itself hides. The dev box, where the
//!   shell answers every real accelerator, is what keeps that assertion
//!   honest.
//! - A desktop change the raise did not cause - a sibling test's window
//!   appearing inside the poll window - reads as a response. Observation
//!   alone cannot attribute a change, so the oracle narrows what it watches
//!   to surface-shaped responses: a shell-host-owned `Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow`
//!   child at the root, or the foreground moving to one (A26-1/A26-9). A
//!   fixture spawning, a toast preview, or a non-CoreWindow flyout moves
//!   none of them, so parallel-suite noise and shell chrome a raise did not
//!   mean to present cannot read as the shell answering a raise.
