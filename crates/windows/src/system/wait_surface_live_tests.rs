//! Windows-only: drives `agent_desktop_core::commands::wait::execute` end to
//! end for `surface-appeared` / `surface-dismissed`, including the
//! unnamed-surface-discovery proof: a `ModalFixture` dialog opened mid-wait,
//! discovered without the caller naming its title or id.
//!
//! Core rejects a surface event without `--app` (`wait_mode.rs:168-177`),
//! but every wait here seeds `CommandContext` with a `capture_signal_baseline`
//! already scoped to the fixture's own `(pid, process_instance)`
//! (`context::with_event_baseline`), so core's `signal_filter` resolves
//! `--app` from that seed via `process_from_baseline` rather than calling
//! `resolve_app` (`wait_event.rs:120-131`). A process-filtered capture can
//! contain at most this one fixture, so the `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET` every other
//! fixture-spawning test in this binary sharing the same re-exec'd image
//! name could otherwise trigger (`wait_event_live_tests.rs`'s module doc
//! explains the hazard) does not arise for this test's own resolution
//! regardless of what else is running concurrently. Each test below still
//! holds `test_support::FIXTURE_APP_NAME_LOCK` for its own `ModalFixture`'s
//! entire lifetime anyway, not to protect itself but so that fixture cannot
//! coexist with a concurrently running `list_apps`-by-name-resolving test
//! (`wait --menu`, `app-launched`) and defeat that other test's resolution.
//!
//! `signal_surfaces_tests.rs` already proves the adapter method's own
//! stability and id properties directly; this file is the layer above it,
//! through the real command a caller actually runs.
