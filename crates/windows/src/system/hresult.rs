//!
//! Both the permission probe and the UI Automation tree path classify and

//!
//! `hresult_record` carries that further: it is the single match naming every
//! HRESULT's `ReadDisposition` *and* its caller-facing `ErrorCode` together.
//! `classify_read_hresult` used to run its own separate match over the same
//! HRESULT set that `crates/windows/src/tree/automation_classify.rs`'s
//! `hresult_disposition` matched independently - the two tables agreed only
//! because both were edited by hand together, and nothing forced that. One
//! record per code makes a code's disposition and its error code the same
//! fact, written once.
