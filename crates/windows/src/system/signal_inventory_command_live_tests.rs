//! Windows-only: drives `agent_desktop_core::commands::wait::execute` end to
//! end through a forced mid-wait capture failure, proving the closed
//! retryable-error contract at the command layer rather than only at
//! `capture_signal_baseline_impl`'s own boundary (`signals_tests.rs`).
//! Registered as a child of `signal_inventory` so it can reach `force_race`,
//! the seam that manufactures the mid-walk identity race this file forces
//! onto exactly one poll.
//!
//! Both waits below narrow by `--window-id` rather than `--app`, so the
//! capture stays unfiltered (`SignalFilter::default()`, matching every
//! `capture_windows_and_apps` call the seam still reaches) while the match
//! itself stays pinned to this fixture's own window - no `resolve_app` call
//! is made, so these two are immune to the same-image-name hazard
//! `test_support::FIXTURE_APP_NAME_LOCK` exists for.
