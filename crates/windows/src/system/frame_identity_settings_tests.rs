//! Windows-only: drives the frame-identity seam against a real hosted

//! instanced on this build, so every staging test records whether
//! `SystemSettings.exe` was running first and, only when the test dispatched
//! `ms-settings:` itself, closes the frame it staged on the way out. Tests
//! that dispatch, send the resume input, or move the foreground hold
//! `SHELL_SURFACE_LOCK` first and the on-screen stage lock second, in the
//! crate-wide lock order: the staging input is global and must not land in
//! a surface another test holds open.
