//! The positive arm of renderer detection, which needs a window whose real
//! Win32 class is the one the detector looks for.
//!
//! The sibling tests in `launch_tests.rs` pin the negative arms: an
//! unresolvable id, and a live window of some other class. Neither fails if
//! the class constant is mistyped, because both expect `None` and a constant
//! that matches nothing still returns `None`. That is precisely the
//! regression worth guarding - the CDP guidance stops being offered and no
//! test notices - so this registers a window class literally named
//! `Chrome_WidgetWin_1` and drives the same `parse_handle` ->
//! `window_class_name` -> compare path a real Chromium window would.
//!
//! The window is message-only: it is never shown, needs no message pump, and
//! `GetClassNameW` answers for it exactly as it does for a top-level window.
