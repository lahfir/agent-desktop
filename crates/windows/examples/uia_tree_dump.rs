//! Dev-box evidence tool: dumps a window's UI Automation tree as JSON through
//! the same COM client, walker, property reader and cache policy the adapter
//! ships.
//!
//! Earlier committed dumps were taken on the **managed** stack, which A2-4
//! measured reporting the identical Notepad window as 3 nodes against 26 on
//! the COM stack. This tool exists so evidence is captured in the stack the
//! product actually uses, and it records the target variant, OS build and
//! client stack that those earlier dumps lacked.
//!
//! Host data is normalised before writing, as those earlier captures already do:
//! process ids, provider ids, window handles and user paths are substituted,
//! and `Name` is recorded as presence and length only.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run -p agent-desktop-windows --example uia_tree_dump -- \
//!     --class Notepad --variant "classic Win32 Notepad" --out notepad-com.json
//! ```
