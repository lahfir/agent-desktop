//! Teardown, proved by observing the desktop rather than by reading the
//! disable command's own answer.
//!
//! `cursor-overlay disable` returning `ok` is the claim under test, so it
//! cannot also be the evidence. Three independent observations stand in for
//! it: the renderer process is gone, the pipe name can be claimed again, and
//! the pixels the overlay painted are no longer on screen.
//!
//! The pipe observation is made through the product rather than by opening
//! the name directly. A test that composed the name itself could drift from
//! the renderer's own derivation and pass while the name was never released;
//! asking the CLI to enable again, and requiring a renderer with a *different*
//! process id, exercises the exact claim path a real caller depends on — a
//! held name makes the fresh child withdraw and the enable time out.
