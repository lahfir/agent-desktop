Skills are compiled into the binary, so they always match this exact
agent-desktop version. Each command prints the JSON envelope; the skill's
markdown is in data.content.

Start here:
  agent-desktop skills get desktop            # Core guide, any OS
  agent-desktop skills get platform           # Guide for the OS you run on

More:
  agent-desktop skills                        # List skills
  agent-desktop skills get desktop workflows  # One reference
  agent-desktop skills get windows            # A named platform guide
  agent-desktop skills path                   # Where skills live")]
