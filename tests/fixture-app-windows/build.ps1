.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the agent-desktop Windows E2E fixture into a runnable WinForms exe.

.DESCRIPTION
    Compiles every .cs file in this directory as one module with the pinned
    in-box .NET Framework compiler, resolved by absolute path rather than
    through PATH so the build cannot silently pick up a different compiler
    on a differently-provisioned box (A24-1). The language level is pinned
    at /langversion:5 rather than left at Default so a future in-box
    compiler upgrade cannot silently start accepting syntax this corpus has
    never compiled against.

    The build is idempotent: output is written to a temporary path first and
    only moved into place once the compile has fully succeeded, so a failed
    build never destroys a previously working artifact.

.PARAMETER OutputDir
    Directory the built AgentDeskFixture.exe is written into. Defaults to
    a "build" directory alongside this script. The harness passes its own
    isolated suite root here.

.OUTPUTS
    Writes "Built: <path>" to stdout on success. Throws on any failure.

    UIAutomationProvider.dll and UIAutomationTypes.dll (needed by the
    zero-bounds and cell-role WM_GETOBJECT providers, A24-9) ship only in
    the GAC on this toolchain, not alongside csc.exe itself - a plain
    /reference:UIAutomationProvider.dll fails with CS0006 because the
    legacy pre-Roslyn compiler does not search the GAC for a bare filename.
    Resolved by globbing the well-known GAC_MSIL layout rather than
    hardcoding the version-hash folder name, so a differently-serviced box
    with the same assembly at a different folder name still resolves it.

    WindowsBase.dll supplies System.Windows.Rect, the boxed type the

    System.Windows.Rect, not a WinForms Rectangle, and that type lives outside

    UIAutomation assemblies above rather than hardcoded, for the same reason.
