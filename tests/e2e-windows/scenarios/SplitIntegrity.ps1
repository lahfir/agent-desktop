    SplitIntegrity.ps1 - U11: confirms live what four sub-phases could only
    unit-test - that a Medium-integrity observation read crosses the
    Medium/High boundary, an input write does not and surfaces a
    fail-closed envelope, and a capture behaves as measured - on staging
    A24-4 proved available on this class of box (CreateRestrictedToken +
    SetTokenInformation, confirmed by reading the live token back). The
    plan's own assumption that window activation *also* fails closed is
    measured false here (Invoke-SplitIntegrityActivationLeg) - Windows
    gates `SetForegroundWindow` by a foreground-lock-timeout heuristic, not
    by Mandatory Integrity Control, so a Medium `focus-window` against the
    High fixture genuinely succeeds. `docs/phases.md`'s window-activation
    bullet is corrected in this same PR.

    Every staged Medium/Low process here is spawned through
    `Start-StagedIntegrityProcess` (StagedProcess.psm1), never through
    `Invoke-GuardedAgent`, which is a .NET Process wrapper and structurally
    cannot run a caller-built restricted token. Every staged invocation that
    touches the fixture inherits the harness's own already-held
    `DesktopLease` handle exactly the way `Invoke-GuardedAgent` inherits it
    for a High-integrity spawn - self-acquiring instead would contend with
    the lock this scenario is already holding and return `TIMEOUT`, which
    the lease-adoption precondition leg exists to rule out before any effect
    leg's `PERM_DENIED` could be misread as that contention.
