    U6SelfTestCasesLease.ps1 - dot-sourced by Invoke-U6SelfTests.ps1. Cases
    7-13: the CI handoff protocol, handoff-variable leakage, lease
    contention at the real canonical path, deep-JSON parsing, the raw
    window/cursor/thread-info P/Invoke surface, the token-user SID oracle,
    and lease-directory validation. Split out of Invoke-U6SelfTests.ps1
    purely to keep both files under the 400-line cap; $AgentDesktopBinary
    and $script:E2EWindowsDir are the caller's own scope (dot-sourcing
    shares it), never re-declared here.
#>

<#
    7. The CI entry path completes with exactly one lock held (R15b): a raw
       parent process opens the canonical lock exclusively and inheritably,
       hands its value to a real child process (Process with redirected
       streams, which sets bInheritHandles=TRUE - Invoke-Guarded/
       Invoke-GuardedAgent deliberately cannot be used here, they strip
       this exact variable by design), the child adopts and reports so, and
       a third process attempting the same exclusive open is refused
       throughout. Invert-verified by forcing the child down the
       self-acquire branch instead of adopting and watching it fail to
       reach the lease at all (the deadlock R15b exists to prevent).
