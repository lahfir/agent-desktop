    AcceptanceContendedFocus.ps1 - the contended focus-steal leg, split out
    of Acceptance.ps1 purely to keep that file under the 400-line cap, the
    same reason InteractionHeaded.ps1 sits beside it. It is dot-sourced by
    Acceptance.ps1 and runs inside that scenario's own registration.

    <# R17b(c): docs/phases.md 2.9's focus-steal budget of 2 rests on A21-6,
       an UNCONTENDED capture (0/5 both attempts); the contended re-measure
       is assigned here because this file already stages open-duplicate-windows
       + ForegroundStage. Judged only by a raw GetForegroundWindow re-read,
       never by focus-window's own answer - A21-6 already measured that
       answer as untrustworthy. A control proves the oracle moves at all
       (stages the contender, reads foreground back BEFORE any focus-window
       is issued) before the N-trial rate is taken; a leg that cannot
       complete N trials fails rather than reporting a partial rate. #>
